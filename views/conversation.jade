                td It's important to ask open-ended questions and remember that this is an unnerving time for everyone. The most trusted authority on the vaccine and whether or not it is safe is the CDC.

                td The decision to get the vaccine or not is entirely yours; it is important that your partner respects your decision. It is also important that whatever decision you make is informed by the science helped develop the vaccine. Consider the following information at this link that describes different demographics' apprehension around the vaccine. Why do you think some groups want it and others don't? What group do you identify with and why?

                td I am confident the vaccine is safe. How do I convince others? 
                td Consider what convinced you! Where does this confidence come from? If someone had made you feel ashamed, would you have felt more or less likely to listen to the perspective they were advocating for? Read this study about Compliance and Self Reporting during COVID. Then, read this article from TIME Magazine about their findings on convincing people to get vaccinated.

        h4 Ultimately, when looking for resources on conversations about COVID-19, the vaccine, or mental health, keep the markers for reputability in mind. 
        h4 If the authors behind a resource aren't transparent about their funding, if it's difficult to find other information that backs up an assertion, consider that this resource might have motives that are less than pure. 
        h3 Accuracy 
        h4 Does this source validate information that can be found elsewhere, from other sources that are credible? Remember that jargon, or the use of technical language, does not necessarily mean the source is credible.
        h3 Authority
        h4 Check the URL of the website: does it end in .gov, .org, .net, or .edu? Some of those endings can influence the perspective of the information the website hosts. 
        h4 Does this source cite other reputable sources?
        h3 Currency 
        h4 How recent is the information hosted on this site? 
        h4 Since there are so many innovations surrounding COVID-19, check that the source is dated within the last few months to be sure they are hosting the most up-to-date information. 
        h3 Coverage 
        h4 Does the source offer information that is relevant to what youâ€™re looking for?
